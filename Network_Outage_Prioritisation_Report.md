## üß† Prioritisation Logic

- **High Priority (Tickets #001 & #002):**  
  - Entire organisations offline.  
  - Business-critical services impacted.  
  - Affects large numbers of users.  
  - Requires **immediate escalation** to network support.

- **Medium Priority (Ticket #005):**  
  - Single user, but critical project affected.  
  - Could escalate if not resolved quickly.  
  - Logged and assigned with SLA of next business day.

- **Low Priority (Tickets #003 & #004):**  
  - Important to users but **less business-wide impact**.  
  - Will be scheduled once high-priority incidents are stabilized.

---

## üì£ Escalation Strategy for Network Outage

- Issue escalated to the **Network Support Team** immediately.  
- Followed ITIL process with documented impact, clients affected, and initial diagnostics.  
- Acknowledged incident in the internal communication dashboard.  
- Coordinated a team-wide call to ensure updates and resources were aligned.

---

## üí° Justification

Prioritisation was based on **impact (number of users affected)** and **urgency (how operations were hindered)**.  
- Network outages were top priority because they halted all business functions.  
- Individual device or login issues, while urgent to users, were not affecting entire organizations.

---

## üèÅ Outcome & Follow-Up Plan

- Clients were notified about the ongoing outage and progress updates were scheduled.  
- Other tickets were assigned and queued with communication templates ready.  
- The response showed an understanding of how to balance urgent large-scale problems with smaller but still time-sensitive requests.
